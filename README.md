## 💻 Portfolio Projects  

### 1) AI Nursing Handover Summarizer (Demo)  
This repository contains a **simple Python script** that creates an extractive summary of a nursing handover note.  
It demonstrates practical text processing for healthcare operations — suitable as a lightweight proof-of-concept.  

> This demo illustrates the ability to translate clinical nursing needs into an informatics solution.  

#### Quick Start  
```bash
python summarizer.py --input sample_handover.txt --top_k 5
